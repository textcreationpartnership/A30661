1. THE
DESIGN
OF THIS
TREATISE.

1. The LORD Jeſus Chriſt hath hiddenly laid up
all the Treaſures of Wiſdom, and of Knowledge
in his Word, wherein are many choice
Myſteries above the reach, and beſides the Rules
of Philoſophy.

1. There is in the Word of Chriſt full comprehenſiveneſs,
as of all other uſeful Learning, ſo particularly,
of the knowledge of Natural Things,
of which it doth treat and ſpeak purpoſely, and
profeſſedly.

1. Seeing we are upon the advancement of uſeful Learning, and ſomewhat
is now to be written about the Augment and Restauration of
the Geographick Chorographick and Topographick Science and Art,
I haue theſe few Queries to propound to the Studious in this kind
of Learning.

1. As for Grammar-Learning, relating to the Original Language in the
Scriptures, I have at preſent theſe conſiderations to propound unto
the Ingenious, and Ingenuous, the Studious, and the learned Linguists
by way of further inquiry.

1. There is much of Spiritual uſe to be made by Believers
of the improved knowledge of Natural things,
for the diſcerning and injoying of fellowſhip with
the Creator and Redeemer.

1. The Holy Scriptures in ſpeaking of the Works of Creation,
and of Natural Things, do ſpeak of them, as
they really are, and not as they ſeemingly only appear;
according to exactneſs of Truth, as the Nature
and Eſſence of them are, and not according to the
wrong conceits, and ignorant miſtakes of vulgar
Minds, and common Opinioniſts.

1. The vain affectation of Humane Wiſdom, which doth
thruſt upon the credulity of ſo many a Doctrine of
probabilities (concerning the works of Creation and
Natural Things) from Anti-Chriſtian and unſcriptural
Philoſophy, but is not according to Chriſt,
and to his Word, is ſuch a deceitful way of falſe
reaſoning, as makes a prey of Souls, and is carefully
to be avoided, and is but falſly named
Science.

1. The vain Affectation of Creature-Knowlede in the
Apoſtate Angels, and of Humane Wiſdom in fallen
Man, has all along been endeavouring to corrupt
and to pervert, both the pure Word of Aelohim,
and his Created Works, whereby they are miſrepreſented
to the Rational-intellect in wrong
ſhapes.

1. Thoſe Books which are commonly called Geneſis,
Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,
or the Book of Moſes, and of his Writings there,
have the approving Teſtimony of thoſe true faithful
Prophets that did follow after him, as alſo of the
LORD Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and of his Apoſtles:
and the Hiſtory of the Creation, and of the Works
thereof in theGen. 1. throughout, & ch. 3. verſ. 1, 2, 3. Beginning of the Bible, is true in
the literal ſenſe, and was intended and recorded ſo
to be underſtood, and all thoſe Philoſophical Allegorical
and Myſtical Senſes, which any do give
thereof, that are contrary unto this, are to be avoided
and rejected.

1. Having led the Reader thus far along in his Way, I ſuppoſe that
now his Expectations are raiſed to meet with ſomewhat of weighty
Inquiry about the Works of Creation on the ſeveral Days, the
clear diſtinct knowledge whereof may have a direct tendency,
and an apparent profitableneſs for the Reſtauration and Inſtauration
of Arts, and the Advancement and Augment of Sciences,
ſuch of both theſe as are uſeful, and ſo far as they are thus uſeful,
and all in a clean way of Pure Religion.

1. Of the One (which when another Day was
Created, was the Firſt) Day of the Created
World, and of ſome of its Works.

1. Paſs we now unto an enquiry concerning the created
Work ofGen. 1. 6—10. the Second Day.

1. One diſtinct work of theGen. 1. 11, 12, 13. third Day, with its peculiar
bleſſing was that of Herbs. The Inquiry,
therefore here ſhall be this,

1. For a further Advance and Augment of uſeful
Science, let it be inquired, from theGen. 1. 14—1••: fourth
Days Work.

1. TheGen. 1. 20—25. Fifth Days Work doth afford us this
Inquiry.

1. TheGen. 1. 26▪ 31. Sixth Day, towards the true Advance of
uſeful Learning, doth give us the hint of this
profitable Inquiry.

1. The Great Deſign of this Treatiſe, being the Advancement and
Augment of uſeful Arts, and of profitable Sciences in a Scripture-way,
I ſhall propound ſome ſerious Inquiries to ingenious,
ſtudious Believers, to ingenuous, diligent Saints: Eſpecially
to ſuch faithful, humble Ones, as have through Mercy
and Grace attained to larger growing meaſures of holy Skill
in the Original Languages, and of excelling eminence in Inner
Religion, about the improvement of Experimental
Chriſtianity.

    _ Inquiries concerning Jehovah Aelohim, in Father,
Son, and Holy Spirt.

    _ Concerning the LORD Jeſus Chriſt Jehovah-man,
the Mediator.

    _ Concerning the Word of God, the Word of
Christ.

    _ Concerning preſent Providences, and Works of Jehovah
Aelohim.

    _ Concerning Duties and Priviledges.

    _ Concerning other practical experimental Christanity?

    _ Concerning ſaving-Grace, and the ſound evidences
thereof.

    _ Concerning Heaven and its Glory.

    _ Concerning ſuch Scripture-Principles, which if admitted
and improved, might have a direct tendency
towards the healing and uniting of the broken
and divided Churches and People of God.
